## Understanding Physical AI: Beyond Digital Intelligence

Physical AI represents the convergence of artificial intelligence with embodied systems that interact with the real world. Unlike traditional AI confined to digital environments, Physical AI enables robots to perceive, reason, and act within physical spaces.

Teaching this concept requires students to understand how machine learning models translate into motor control, sensor fusion, and real-time decision-making. The curriculum should highlight the difference between simulated environments and real-world constraints, including latency, sensor noise, and unpredictable dynamics that challenge purely algorithmic approaches.

## Core Competencies for Humanoid Robotics

A comprehensive humanoid robotics course must balance theoretical knowledge with practical skills. Students need foundations in kinematics, dynamics, and control theory to understand bipedal locomotion and manipulation tasks.

The curriculum should cover actuator technologies—from traditional servo motors to advanced artificial muscles—as well as sensor systems such as IMUs, force sensors, and computer vision tools. Programming skills in ROS (Robot Operating System) and Python are essential, enabling students to implement algorithms for balance control, path planning, and human-robot interaction protocols.
